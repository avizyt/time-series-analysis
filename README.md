# Learning Time Series Analysis with Python

## Fundamentals

    - Time series Nomenclature
      - Current Time = t
      - observation at current time = y(t) or obs(t)
      - what is lags?
        - Observation before the current times, called lags.
      - Times in the past are negative relative to the current time.
      - So, precious time of t will be t-1 ,t-2 before that and so on.
      - Time in the future or the forecast is positive relative to the current time.
      - So, future time of t will be t+1, t+2 after that and so on.
